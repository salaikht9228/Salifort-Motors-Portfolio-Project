# Decision Tree Classification of Salifort Motors' Employees
## Overview
This project aimed to create a decision tree, random forest, and XGBoost model to predict whether an employee will stay or leave the Salifort Motors company. This project utilized a dataset called [HR_capstone_dataset.csv](data/HR_capstone_dataset.csv), which contains information about employees who worked at Salifort Motors company. The final champion decision tree classification model performed with 94% accuracy and 91% recall, determining what features were most important in determining whether an employee would stay or leave the company. Based on the model, the number of assigned projects, last evaluation scores, tenure of work, and whether an employee is overworked (>170 hours per month) or not were most influential in determining whether an employee left or stayed with the company. [Overview of the features mentioned above, comparing between those who stayed versus left, can be found on Tableau Public.](https://public.tableau.com/shared/QFGXJQRTY?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)
