# Decision Tree Classification of Salifort Motors' Employees
## Overview
This project aimed to create a decision tree, random forest and XGBoost model to predict whether an employee will stay or leave the Salifort Motors company. This project utilized a dataset called [HR_capstone_dataset.csv](data/HR_capstone_dataset.csv), which contains information about employees who worked in Salifort Motors company. The final champion decision tree classification model performed with 94% accuracy and 91% recall, determining what features were most important in determining whether an employee will stay or leave the company. Based on the model, numbers of assigned project, last evaluation scores, tenure of work and whether an employee is overworked (>170 hours per month) or not were most influential in determining an employee leaving or staying with the company. [Overview of the above mentioned features, comparing between those who stayed versus left, can be found on Tableau Public.](https://public.tableau.com/shared/QFGXJQRTY?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)
